# Real-and-Fake-Face-Detection
This dataset is taken from Kaggle by Computational Intelligence and Photography Lab, Yonsei University (https://www.kaggle.com/ciplab/real-and-fake-face-detection)

I manually moved 100 images from each category (fake and real) training set as the validation set and 10 images from each category as the test set.
